## Session Cookies Explained

### What is a Session Cookie?

A session cookie is a small piece of data that websites use to remember you're logged in. Think of it as a temporary ID card that proves to the website that you've already entered your username and password. This allows the fanfic downloader to access your private bookmarks and age-restricted content just as if you were browsing the site yourself.

### Why Do I Need It?

- **Access Private Bookmarks**: Download works you've bookmarked privately
- **Age-Restricted Content**: Access mature/explicit content if you're logged in
- **Avoid Rate Limits**: Logged-in users often have more generous download limits
- **Personal Collections**: Access your personal collections and reading history

### How to Get Your Session Cookie

#### For Chrome/Edge:

1. **Log into AO3** with your account
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools (or right-click → Inspect)
3. **Click the "Application" tab** (might be under >> if not visible)
4. **In the left sidebar**, expand "Cookies" and click on "archiveofourown.org"
5. **Find the cookie named "_otwarchive_session"**
6. **Copy the entire value** (it's a long string of random characters)

#### For Firefox:

1. **Log into AO3** with your account
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Click the "Storage" tab**
4. **Expand "Cookies" and click on "https://archiveofourown.org"**
5. **Find "_otwarchive_session"**
6. **Copy the value**

#### For Safari:

1. **Enable Developer Menu**: Safari → Preferences → Advanced → Show Develop menu
2. **Log into AO3**
3. **Develop → Show Web Inspector**
4. **Storage tab → Cookies → archiveofourown.org**
5. **Find and copy "_otwarchive_session" value**

### Security Notes

- **Keep it private**: Your session cookie is like a password - don't share it
- **Temporary**: Session cookies expire (usually after a few hours/days)
- **Refresh when needed**: If downloads stop working, get a fresh cookie
- **Safe usage**: This app stores cookies locally and never transmits them anywhere

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the application**
2. **Paste your session cookie** in the Settings section
3. **Choose download method** (Bookmarks, Series, Batch URLs, etc.)
4. **Select output format** (HTML, PDF, EPUB, or MOBI)
5. **Click "Start Download"**

Downloads are automatically organized by fandom and author in timestamped folders.

## Troubleshooting

### CAPTCHA Challenges

AO3 occasionally presents CAPTCHA challenges to prevent automated access. Here's how to handle them:

#### Automatic Detection
The app detects CAPTCHA challenges and will:
1. **Pause downloads** immediately
2. **Show a notification** with instructions
3. **Open a browser window** to the CAPTCHA page

#### Manual Resolution
1. **Complete the CAPTCHA** in the opened browser
2. **Stay logged in** to maintain your session
3. **Click "Continue Downloads"** in the app
4. The app will resume using your refreshed session

#### Prevention Tips
- **Space out downloads**: Add delays between downloads (configurable in settings)
- **Vary your pattern**: Don't download hundreds of works in sequence
- **Use during off-peak hours**: Less likely to trigger protection
- **Maintain activity**: Occasionally browse AO3 normally between bulk downloads

### Common Issues

#### "Session Cookie Invalid"
- **Cause**: Cookie expired or copied incorrectly
- **Solution**: Get a fresh cookie following the guide above

#### "Cannot Convert to MOBI"
- **Cause**: MOBI conversion requires additional tools
- **Solution**: Install KindleGen or use the built-in EPUB format

#### "Access Denied" Errors
- **Cause**: Work may be restricted or deleted
- **Solution**: Verify you can access the work while logged in

#### "Connection Timeout"
- **Cause**: Network issues or AO3 server problems
- **Solution**: Check your internet, try again later, or increase timeout in settings

#### Download Speed Issues
- **Cause**: Rate limiting or server load
- **Solution**: Enable download delays in settings (recommended: 2-5 seconds)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
1. Settings → Advanced → Enable Debug Mode
2. Logs are saved to `fanfic_downloader_debug.log`
3. Include logs when reporting issues
